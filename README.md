# CIFAR-10-Neural-Network

Implement a neural network and utilize the CIFAR-10 dataset for the analysis.

1. Utilize various activation functions like sigmoid, tanh and critique the performance in
each case.

3. Increase the depth of the given network by adding more Fully-Connected layers till the
point you encounter the vanishing gradient problem. With the help of the results, mention
how to identify it.

5. Suggest and implement methods to overcome the above problem.
